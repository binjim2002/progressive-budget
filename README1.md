# Description

 The BUDGETTRACKER app is an amazing application that I have designed to help our users track, store and keep an eye on their expenses as well as their budget regardless of whether they are online or offline (meaning that you could be on the airplane and be on the airplane mode but still able to access you application and use it) 

# Installation

Clone the repository from heroku. Open the file the output folder and the open the server.js by simply running npm start, and finally going to the browser and type http://localhost:3000.

# Usage
Using the BUDGETTRACKER app is easy and simple. As soon as you open the app, you'll be prompt to the welcome page with different boxes such as : Name of Transaction, transaction amount, add funds and substract funds.
The next steps for you will be to fill in those boxes and you will be provided with a nice graphic explain your expenses or budget
